# Autonomous-Car-Using-RaspberryPi-and-Arduino
Combining a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno creates a powerful autonomous car. The Pi acts as the brain, handling high-level tasks like camera processing for lane following using OpenCV. The Arduino Uno serves as the reliable nervous system, directly controlling the motor drivers for precise wheel movement.
